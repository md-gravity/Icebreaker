## Starting Point
It will be a steep climb, but step by step we will get there.

It's better to set it up once than every time. Good luck and have fun ðŸª–

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install nvm
nvm install 19

npm i --include-workspace-root
```

So, you have the necessary packages installed, but now you're wondering how to connect them to external services like databases. ðŸ¤” 
Not to worry, you can accomplish this using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Skaffold.

With these tools, you can automate the installation and building of all the necessary dependencies, making the process feel almost magical ðŸª„. 
For example, you can easily install and connect PostgreSQL, NATS Streaming service, and other services to your API services.

```bash
brew  install --cask docker
brew install skaffold
brew install minikube

minikube start
minikube addons enable metrics-server
minikube addons enable ingress

# Add to /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 gravity.io

# Build and Deploy Containers
cd deployment/k8s
skaffold dev

# Finally... In new terminal window ðŸ˜­ Release Icebreaker ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
sudo minikube tunnel

# Visit http://gravity.io ðŸš€
```

## Debugger
The debugger is an essential tool in the software development process. It enables developers to analyze and troubleshoot issues in their code by providing a clear understanding of how the code is executed.

With the help of a debugger, developers can step through their code, inspect variables, and identify and fix errors more efficiently. This saves time and effort in the development process, ultimately resulting in more reliable and robust software.

To make debugging easier, we have developed a debugger that you can use alongside your application. We recommend running your application in debug mode and opening it in the debugger to get a comprehensive view of your code's behavior. 
This will enable you to identify and resolve issues more quickly and effectively.

Search port of debug service in your terminal:
```bash
kubectl get services | grep "debug"
```

Then connect debugger to these services in your [browser](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/debugging/remote_debugger) or IDE.
